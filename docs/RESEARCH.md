## Model Family Snapshot

| Model | Core Positioning | Notable Claim (official) |
|---|---|---|
| Qwen3-ASR-1.7B | Accuracy-first ASR | SOTA among open-source ASR models |
| Qwen3-ASR-0.6B | Efficiency-first ASR | 92 ms TTFT, 2000 s/s at concurrency 128 |
| Qwen3-ForcedAligner-0.6B | NAR forced alignment | 11-language alignment, 80 ms segment resolution |

## Config Facts (from HF `config.json`)

### Qwen3-ASR-1.7B
- Audio: `encoder_layers=24`, `encoder_attention_heads=16`, `d_model=1024`, `output_dim=2048`
- Text: `hidden_size=2048`, `num_hidden_layers=28`, GQA `num_attention_heads=16`, `num_key_value_heads=8`
- Audio chunk params: `n_window=50`, `n_window_infer=800`, `conv_chunksize=500`

### Qwen3-ASR-0.6B
- Audio: `encoder_layers=18`, `encoder_attention_heads=14`, `d_model=896`, `output_dim=1024`
- Text: `hidden_size=1024`, `num_hidden_layers=28`, GQA `16/8`
- Audio chunk params: `n_window=50`, `n_window_infer=800`, `conv_chunksize=500`

### Qwen3-ForcedAligner-0.6B
- Top-level extras: `timestamp_token_id=151705`, `timestamp_segment_time=80`, `classify_num=5000`
- Audio: `encoder_layers=24`, `encoder_attention_heads=16`, `d_model=1024`, `output_dim=1024`
- Text: `hidden_size=1024`, `num_hidden_layers=28`, GQA `16/8`

## Encoder Length Formula (Critical for Correctness)

Official upstream uses per-100-frame chunk logic:

```text
input_lengths_leave = input_lengths % 100
feat_lengths = (input_lengths_leave - 1) // 2 + 1
output_lengths = ((feat_lengths - 1) // 2 + 1 - 1) // 2 + 1 + (input_lengths // 100) * 13
```

This means exact multiples of 100 frames map to `13 * n_chunks` tokens
(e.g., 400 -> 52, 1000 -> 130), not simple full-sequence 8x downsampling.

## Mac/MLX Implementation Landscape (2026-02-14)

- `ml-explore/mlx-audio` includes a Qwen3-ASR path and remains the most visible
  upstream MLX code path.
- `ivan-digital/qwen3-asr-swift` is a native Swift+MLX ASR/TTS implementation
  with packaged quantized ASR models and published ASR latency claims.
  - Repo: https://github.com/ivan-digital/qwen3-asr-swift
  - Evidence: `Sources/Qwen3ASR/Qwen3ASR.swift` exposes `transcribe(...) -> String`
- `Flovflo/VoiceScribe` is a native macOS dictation app built on Swift+MLX
  Qwen3-ASR models.
  - Repo: https://github.com/Flovflo/VoiceScribe
  - Evidence: `Sources/VoiceScribeCore/ML/Models/Qwen3ASR.swift`
- `Jason-Queen/Qwen3-ASR-MLX-Server` is a server wrapper over `mlx-audio`, not a
  standalone model-core reimplementation.
  - Repo: https://github.com/Jason-Queen/Qwen3-ASR-MLX-Server
  - Evidence: imports `mlx_audio.stt.*` in `whisper_mlx_server.py`
- `predict-woo/qwen3-asr.cpp` is a notable non-MLX native implementation that
  includes a dedicated forced aligner in C++/GGML.
  - Repo: https://github.com/predict-woo/qwen3-asr.cpp
  - Evidence: `src/forced_aligner.cpp`, `src/forced_aligner.h`

## Forced Aligner and Timestamp Facts

- Official Qwen timestamping is a separate model:
  `Qwen/Qwen3-ForcedAligner-0.6B`.
- In official `qwen-asr`, `return_time_stamps=True` requires initializing a
  `forced_aligner`; otherwise it raises an explicit error.
- Official streaming path does **not** support timestamps in that stack.

## Swift Timestamp Status (Evidence-Based)

- In `ivan-digital/qwen3-asr-swift`, ASR docs and source currently show
  transcription support but no ASR timestamp/forced-aligner implementation in
  the public ASR module surface (`transcribe(...) -> String`).
- The repo roadmap lists ASR streaming as pending; no published native forced
  alignment API is present in its ASR modules/docs today.
- `Flovflo/VoiceScribe` focuses on dictation transcription flow; no dedicated
  forced-aligner/timestamp module is exposed in the public repo structure.

## Forced Aligner Direction Implication

- A native timestamp path is technically feasible (evidence: C++ `qwen3-asr.cpp`
  already ships a dedicated aligner implementation), but there is no widely
  adopted Apple-MLX-native forced-aligner reference implementation to reuse
  directly today.
- Practical takeaway for this repo:
  1. Keep optional `qwen-asr` backend for immediate user value.
  2. Build native MLX aligner behind strict quality gates (word timing quality
     and parity checks) before making it default.

## Practical MLX Optimization Guidance from Upstream Code

- `mlx-lm`'s `KVCache` uses in-place slice writes and stepped growth strategy;
  this is the proven baseline pattern for decode-time cache efficiency.
- Quantized model loading in MLX stacks generally applies module quantization
  before weight loading and persists quantization metadata in config.
- For this repo, measured wins continue to come from:
  tokenizer/model caching, preallocated KV paths, and validated quant profiles
  (`4-bit`, `group_size=64`) rather than speculative asynchronous decode logic.

## Source Audit: Mel + Streaming (2026-02-14)

This section records the exact primary sources used for current mel/streaming
architecture decisions.

### A) Official Qwen streaming semantics

- File: `qwen_asr/inference/qwen3_asr.py`
  - `init_streaming_state(...)` + `streaming_transcribe(...)` + `finish_streaming_transcribe(...)`.
  - Behavior: streaming re-feeds accumulated audio and uses rollback controls
    (`unfixed_chunk_num`, `unfixed_token_num`), with vLLM-only support.
- Source:
  - https://github.com/QwenLM/Qwen3-ASR/blob/main/qwen_asr/inference/qwen3_asr.py

### B) Whisper feature extraction reference behavior

- File: `transformers/models/whisper/feature_extraction_whisper.py`
  - `_np_extract_fbank_features(...)` drops final STFT frame via `log_spec = log_spec[:, :-1]`.
  - This explains common +1 frame mismatches in naive custom mel paths.
- Source:
  - https://github.com/huggingface/transformers/blob/main/src/transformers/models/whisper/feature_extraction_whisper.py

### C) Swift implementation landscape check

- Repo: `ivan-digital/qwen3-asr-swift`
  - Public ASR surface is offline `transcribe(...)`; no dedicated ASR streaming
    module found in `Sources/Qwen3ASR`.
- Source:
  - https://github.com/ivan-digital/qwen3-asr-swift/tree/main/Sources/Qwen3ASR

### D) MLX cache design references

- Repo: `ml-explore/mlx-lm`
  - Multiple model implementations rely on explicit cache offset tracking and
    `update_and_fetch` patterns for incremental decode.
- Source:
  - https://github.com/ml-explore/mlx-lm

Decision implication for this repo:
- Do not switch to custom mel by default until strict parity gates pass.
- Keep streaming marked experimental until a true resumable decode-cache path lands.

## External Audit Refresh (GitHub + Papers, 2026-02-14)

This pass re-checked upstream repos and paper artifacts to confirm roadmap priority.

### 1) Official streaming is still constrained upstream

- In official `qwen-asr`, streaming state is documented as **vLLM-only** and
  **no timestamps**:
  - https://github.com/QwenLM/Qwen3-ASR/blob/main/qwen_asr/inference/qwen3_asr.py#L596-L599
- The streaming implementation explicitly re-feeds all accumulated audio each chunk:
  - https://github.com/QwenLM/Qwen3-ASR/blob/main/qwen_asr/inference/qwen3_asr.py#L670-L673
- Timestamping in official stack is a separate forced aligner model and code path:
  - https://github.com/QwenLM/Qwen3-ASR/blob/main/qwen_asr/inference/qwen3_forced_aligner.py#L309
  - https://github.com/QwenLM/Qwen3-ASR/blob/main/qwen_asr/inference/qwen3_forced_aligner.py#L394

### 2) Swift ecosystem status on ASR timestamps/streaming

- `ivan-digital/qwen3-asr-swift` public ASR API currently exposes
  `transcribe(...) -> String` (no timestamp object surface in this API):
  - https://github.com/ivan-digital/qwen3-asr-swift/blob/main/Sources/Qwen3ASR/Qwen3ASR.swift#L52-L57
- Its README roadmap still lists **ASR streaming inference** as pending:
  - https://github.com/ivan-digital/qwen3-asr-swift/blob/main/README.md#roadmap
- Existing ASR speed claims in that repo are strong and useful as external target points:
  - https://github.com/ivan-digital/qwen3-asr-swift/blob/main/README.md#latency-m2-max-64-gb

### 3) Other GitHub landscape notes

- `Jason-Queen/Qwen3-ASR-MLX-Server` is service glue over `mlx-audio`, not a clean
  standalone model-core implementation:
  - https://github.com/Jason-Queen/Qwen3-ASR-MLX-Server/blob/main/whisper_mlx_server.py#L33-L34
- `ontypehq/mlx-swift-asr` is another native Swift effort with strong runtime focus
  (useful for implementation ideas and benchmark comparison):
  - https://github.com/ontypehq/mlx-swift-asr

### 4) Model artifact availability (HuggingFace)

- Official models:
  - https://huggingface.co/Qwen/Qwen3-ASR-1.7B
  - https://huggingface.co/Qwen/Qwen3-ASR-0.6B
  - https://huggingface.co/Qwen/Qwen3-ForcedAligner-0.6B
- MLX-community quantized variants for both ASR and forced aligner already exist
  (4/5/6/8-bit variants), which reduces packaging risk for Mac-native workflows:
  - https://huggingface.co/mlx-community/Qwen3-ASR-0.6B-4bit
  - https://huggingface.co/mlx-community/Qwen3-ASR-1.7B-8bit
  - https://huggingface.co/mlx-community/Qwen3-ForcedAligner-0.6B-4bit
  - https://huggingface.co/mlx-community/Qwen3-ForcedAligner-0.6B-8bit

### 5) Academic and MLX optimization references

- Qwen3-ASR technical report (primary paper source):
  - https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21337
- MLX official optimization docs (compile/lazy evaluation/streams), relevant to
  stable hot-path design and benchmarking discipline:
  - https://ml-explore.github.io/mlx/build/html/usage/compile.html
  - https://ml-explore.github.io/mlx/build/html/usage/lazy_evaluation.html
  - https://ml-explore.github.io/mlx/build/html/usage/using_streams.html

### Practical Implication

- Near-term highest ROI remains: correctness parity, native aligner quality gates,
  quantized artifact quality, and decode-path cleanliness.
- Streaming should remain explicit experimental scope, not a production-critical
  investment lane until core offline quality and performance goals are saturated.

## Encoder Long-Context Optimization (2026-02-14)

We validated a hybrid encoder-window strategy for long audio:

- For smaller window counts, keep dense block-mask execution.
- For larger window counts, switch to segmented per-window execution, which is
  mathematically equivalent to block-diagonal masking but avoids dense `(L, L)` mask
  overhead.

Threshold decision:

- Use segmented execution when `num_windows >= 20`.

Benchmark artifact (synthetic, same weights/inputs, 8-layer encoder):

- `docs/benchmarks/2026-02-14-encoder-windowing-threshold.json`
- `docs/benchmarks/2026-02-14-encoder-windowing-threshold.md`

Observed:

- small context (`8 windows`): dense path is faster,
- crossover around `16-20 windows`,
- long context (`80 windows`): segmented path showed ~`4.17x` speedup with
  max-abs output diff on the order of `1e-6`.
