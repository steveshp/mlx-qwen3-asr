# Evaluation Coverage Matrix

This document tracks what is measured today versus what remains before we can
make broad "production-grade across languages/conditions" quality claims.

## Current Measured Coverage

- Token parity:
  - English mixed-condition lane (clean/other/long/noise): 22 samples.
  - Multilingual manifest lanes:
    - smoke: 4 samples (EN/CN/JA/DE),
    - medium: 20 samples (10 languages x 2),
    - expanded: 100 samples (10 languages x 10).
  - Long-form multilingual parity lane:
    - 10 synthetic concatenated clips (~75-90s each, 10 languages),
    - strict token/text parity currently `0.0` (all mismatch; early divergence).
- Aligner parity:
  - 50 LibriSpeech test-clean samples (MLX vs official qwen_asr backend).
- WER/CER lane:
  - LibriSpeech test-clean, 100 samples, speaker-balanced, 0.6B model
    (`fp16`, `4-bit`, `8-bit`).
  - LibriSpeech test-other, 100 samples, speaker-balanced, 0.6B model
    (`fp16`, `4-bit`, `8-bit`).
  - LibriSpeech test-clean + test-other, 100 samples each, 1.7B model
    (`fp16`).
  - FLEURS multilingual manifest-quality lane:
    - 100 short-form samples (10 languages x 10),
    - refreshed for both 0.6B and 1.7B (`fp16`),
    - Unicode-safe WER/CER + language-aware primary metric.
  - Long-form multilingual manifest-quality lane:
    - 10 synthetic concatenated clips (~75-90s each, 10 languages),
    - Unicode-safe WER/CER with language-aware primary metric
      (CER for zh/ja/ko; WER otherwise).
- MLX-vs-PyTorch head-to-head:
  - Multilingual-100 direct comparison (MLX: 15.99% WER vs PyTorch: 16.69% WER).
  - LibriSpeech test-other direct comparison (MLX: 4.20% WER vs PyTorch: 4.41% WER).
  - Long-form manifest direct comparison (MLX: 16.71% WER vs PyTorch: 24.31% WER).
  - Versioned benchmark artifacts committed under `docs/benchmarks/`.
- Streaming diagnostics lane:
  - Per-session quality metrics exposed from runtime state:
    `partial_stability`, `rewrite_rate`, `finalization_delta_chars`.
  - KV-cache streaming with linear complexity (not O(n^2) re-transcription).
  - Tooling:
    - `scripts/eval_streaming_metrics.py` (single-run diagnostics probe),
    - `scripts/benchmark_streaming.py` (`streaming_quality` summary payload).
  - Strict release gate now includes a bounded streaming-quality check on
    fixture audio for `fixed` and `energy` endpointing modes.
- Release quality gate (all green):
  - ruff check, typed-core mypy, full pytest (363 tests), reference parity,
    LibriSpeech eval, manifest quality eval, benchmark ASR.
  - RTF=0.1526, latency_mean=0.3865s.

## Closed Gaps

1. **Non-English quality lane** — CLOSED. Multilingual quality lanes for both
   short-form (`n=100`) and long-form synthetic (`n=10`) across 10 languages
   with Unicode-safe WER/CER and language-aware primary metric (CER for
   zh/ja/ko, WER otherwise).

2. **Long-form quality lane** — CLOSED (synthetic). 10 synthetic concatenated
   clips (~75-90s each, 10 languages) with quality metrics. Real-world
   long-form remains a stretch goal.

3. **MLX-vs-PyTorch quality comparison** — PARTIALLY CLOSED.
   Multilingual-100, test-other, and long-form head-to-head artifacts exist.
   MLX wins on all three lanes (15.99% vs 16.69% WER; 4.20% vs 4.41% WER;
   16.71% vs 24.31% WER). Real-world head-to-head remains open.

4. **Streaming quality instrumentation** — CLOSED. Full instrumentation with
   `partial_stability`, `rewrite_rate`, `finalization_delta_chars`. KV-cache
   streaming shipped with linear complexity.

## Remaining Gaps (prioritized)

1. `P1` Real-world audio lane (meetings/podcasts/accented speech)
   - Why: LibriSpeech + FLEURS is too clean for deployment confidence.
   - Status: not yet part of committed evaluation matrix.

2. `P2` Real-world long-form lane (multi-minute, non-synthetic)
   - Why: synthetic concatenation doesn't capture real discourse patterns.
   - Status: synthetic lane exists; real-world recordings needed.

3. `P2` Streaming quality dataset lane (committed artifacts)
   - Why: instrumentation is in place but no versioned benchmark dataset.
   - Status: strict release now gates fixture-level streaming quality; next step
     is multi-file versioned dataset artifacts.

4. `P2` Broader MLX-vs-PyTorch comparison
   - Why: real-world head-to-head lanes are still missing.
   - Status: multilingual-100 + test-other + long-form are now covered.

## Follow-up Order

1. Curate real-world audio lane with fixed artifact set and versioned manifests.
2. Add real-world long-form recordings (meetings, podcasts, lectures).
3. Commit streaming-quality versioned artifacts.
4. Expand MLX-vs-PyTorch comparison to real-world lanes.
