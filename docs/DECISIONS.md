# Technical Decisions

Key technical decisions made for mlx-qwen3-asr, with rationale.

## Decision 1: Python + MLX

**Choice:** Python with Apple's MLX framework
**Alternatives considered:** Rust, Swift, C++

**Rationale:**
- MLX has no Rust bindings -- the framework is Python and C++ only
- 95% of runtime is spent in Metal/C++ kernels inside MLX -- Python overhead is negligible
- Swift port already exists (qwen3-asr-swift) -- no need to duplicate
- Python ecosystem makes it easy to integrate with HuggingFace, numpy, etc.
- Fastest path to a working implementation

## Decision 2: Standalone Package (not part of mlx-audio)

**Choice:** Independent `mlx-qwen3-asr` package
**Alternative:** Contribute to mlx-audio

**Rationale:**
- mlx-audio has critical bugs for Qwen3-ASR:
  - Uses standard nn.RoPE instead of interleaved MRoPE
  - Issue #459: long-audio truncation
  - Historical config drift risk across revisions
- mlx-audio depends on bleeding-edge packages: `transformers==5.0.0rc3`, `mlx-lm==0.30.5`
- Qwen3-ASR deserves dedicated focus -- it's SOTA and complex enough to warrant its own package
- Standalone allows us to optimize specifically for this model without compromise

## Decision 3: Dual Timestamp Backends with Native-First Default (Superseded by Decision 20)

**Choice:** Use native MLX backend (`mlx`) as default timestamp path while
keeping `qwen_asr` as explicit official-reference option and `auto` fallback mode
**Alternative:** Keep `qwen_asr` as default backend

**Rationale:**
- Native MLX backend removes PyTorch runtime dependency from default timestamp use.
- `qwen_asr` remains the official reference implementation path and stays
  available as an explicit backend for conservative parity checks.
- Dual-backend design lets users choose:
  - native default (`mlx`),
  - official reference (`qwen_asr`),
  - pragmatic fallback (`auto`).
- This keeps native-first UX while preserving explicit reference fallback.

**Policy (important):**
- This is a transition state, not the end-state architecture.
- Project north star remains full native MLX for core + timestamps.
- Keep expanding native parity gates (timing quality + reliability +
  multilingual coverage + performance envelope) until `qwen_asr` is no longer
  needed in standard workflows.

## Decision 4: HuggingFace Tokenizer (Superseded by Decision 18)

**Choice:** Use `transformers.AutoTokenizer` (Qwen2TokenizerFast)
**Alternative:** Reimplement BPE tokenizer from scratch

**Rationale:**
- Qwen2TokenizerFast has 151936 tokens -- reimplementing is high effort, low value
- The tokenizer is well-tested and handles all edge cases
- Accept `transformers` as a dependency (needed for tokenizer only, not model inference)
- Tokenization is not a performance bottleneck

## Decision 5: ffmpeg for Audio Loading

**Choice:** Subprocess call to ffmpeg
**Alternative:** librosa, soundfile, torchaudio

**Rationale:**
- Same approach as mlx-whisper -- proven pattern
- Handles all audio formats (mp3, wav, flac, ogg, m4a, etc.)
- No additional Python dependencies (librosa pulls in many)
- ffmpeg is universally available (`brew install ffmpeg`)
- Consistent behavior across audio formats

## Decision 6: On-the-fly Weight Remapping

**Choice:** Remap HF weights at load time (strip `thinker.` prefix, transpose Conv2d)
**Alternative:** Require pre-converted weights

**Rationale:**
- Users can point directly at HuggingFace repo -- no separate conversion step
- Remapping is fast (< 1 second) compared to model download
- Reduces friction for new users
- Still support pre-converted local weights for advanced users

## Decision 7: Interleaved MRoPE (Custom Implementation)

**Choice:** Custom InterleavedMRoPE class instead of MLX's built-in nn.RoPE
**Alternative:** Use nn.RoPE with workarounds

**Rationale:**
- MLX's nn.RoPE doesn't support 3D interleaved frequency assignment
- The interleaving pattern (stride-3 across sections [24,20,20]) is specific to Qwen3
- Incorrect RoPE produces plausible but degraded transcription -- hard to debug
- This is the #1 bug in existing implementations (mlx-audio gets this wrong)
- Correctness is non-negotiable for the core position encoding

## Decision 8: Default Runtime Model = 0.6B

**Choice:** Default `transcribe()` and CLI to `Qwen/Qwen3-ASR-0.6B`
**Alternative:** Keep 1.7B as the default

**Rationale:**
- "One-line and it just works" is stronger with 0.6B on typical Mac hardware
- Lower memory footprint reduces first-run friction and OOM risk
- Better latency by default improves perceived product quality
- 1.7B remains a first-class opt-in for accuracy-focused workloads

## Decision 9: Native JA/KO Aligner Tokenization Mirrors Official Dependencies

**Choice:** For native MLX aligner path, require `nagisa` (JA) and `soynlp` + official
Korean dict (KO), and fail clearly when missing.
**Alternative:** Silent fallback to generic space/CJK tokenization.

**Rationale:**
- Timestamp quality gates require tokenizer behavior to match the official processor.
- Silent fallback hides quality degradation and weakens parity guarantees.
- Clear runtime errors are preferable to silent low-quality alignment in multilingual use.
- Vendoring the official Korean dictionary asset keeps behavior reproducible across machines.

## Decision 10: Prefer Direct `Qwen2Tokenizer` Loader over `AutoTokenizer` (Superseded by Decision 18)

**Choice:** In tokenizer loading, import and instantiate `Qwen2Tokenizer` directly when
available, with `AutoTokenizer` as fallback.
**Alternative:** Always use `AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(...)`.

**Rationale:**
- `AutoTokenizer` dynamic import path pulls significantly more module graph at cold start.
- Direct `Qwen2Tokenizer` reduces process-level first-transcribe latency while preserving
  tokenization behavior and parity gates.
- Fallback path retains compatibility with older/variant transformer stacks.

## Decision 11: Resolve Local Model Snapshot Path Before Tokenizer Load

**Choice:** Pass resolved local model path (HF snapshot directory) to tokenizer loading
once the model is already resolved by `_ModelHolder`.
**Alternative:** Keep passing the original repo ID string to tokenizer loading.

**Rationale:**
- Repo-ID tokenizer loading may still perform Hub metadata checks in short-lived processes.
- Resolved local path removes that network overhead when weights/tokenizer files are already cached.
- This complements Decision 10 and further reduces first-transcribe latency without affecting quality.

## Decision 12: Streaming Uses Bounded Rolling Context Until True Incremental Decode Lands

**Choice:** Keep streaming as a rolling decode mode with a fixed max context window
(default 30s), explicitly marked experimental.
**Alternative:** Market current streaming as full incremental realtime ASR.

**Rationale:**
- Rolling context keeps per-chunk runtime bounded instead of growing with total session length.
- Prefix-rollback behavior remains useful for partial-output stability.
- This avoids over-claiming while preserving a usable API for live transcription workflows.
- A true production incremental mode still requires decoder cache lifecycle + chunk-level
  audio encoder state strategy; that remains on the roadmap.

## Decision 13: Add Explicit `Session` API While Keeping One-Liner Convenience

**Choice:** Introduce a first-class `Session` object that owns model/tokenizer state,
while preserving top-level `transcribe(...)` for simple usage.
**Alternative:** Keep only hidden process-global holders.

**Rationale:**
- Explicit state ownership is easier to reason about and test.
- Multiple model sessions can coexist in one process without implicit coupling.
- Keeps power-user workflows deterministic while preserving beginner ergonomics.

## Decision 14: Keep Streaming Experimental and Deprioritize Productionization

**Choice:** Keep streaming clearly labeled experimental and avoid major engineering
investment until core offline quality/speed gates are fully saturated.
**Alternative:** Spend near-term roadmap bandwidth on production-grade streaming.

**Rationale:**
- Qwen3-ASR's strongest practical value today is high-quality multilingual
  post-recording transcription.
- Current upstream streaming semantics are themselves constrained
  (vLLM-only and no timestamps), so production streaming is not a short path.
- Near-term engineering ROI is higher in correctness gates, native aligner quality,
  benchmark rigor, quantized packaging, and decode-path cleanliness.

## Decision 15: Adopt Upstream-Style ASR Output Repetition Cleanup

**Choice:** Apply repetition cleanup + edge-case parsing in `parse_asr_output(...)`,
aligned with official Qwen inference utility behavior.
**Alternative:** Keep minimal parser that only splits on `<asr_text>`.

**Rationale:**
- Repetition collapse directly reduces pathological decode tails in real-world audio.
- Handling `language None` and forced-language parse paths improves robustness.
- This is a low-risk, high-value inference-time quality safeguard.

## Decision 16: Harden Experimental Streaming Input Contracts and Remove Dead State

**Choice:** Validate streaming init params, normalize incoming PCM in `feed_audio(...)`,
and remove unused `previous_tokens` state.
**Alternative:** Keep permissive/unvalidated inputs and retain unused state fields.

**Rationale:**
- Upstream streaming path normalizes int16/shape behavior explicitly; matching that
  reduces avoidable runtime surprises.
- Strong input contracts (`chunk_size_sec/max_context_sec/sample_rate > 0`) fail fast
  with clear errors instead of silent undefined behavior.
- Removing dead state simplifies the module and makes future incremental refactors clearer.

## Decision 17: Keep Speculative Decoding as Opt-In Experimental Path

**Choice:** Implement speculative decoding behind explicit `draft_model` opt-in and
keep baseline greedy decode as default.
**Alternative:** Promote speculative decoding to default generation path immediately.

**Rationale:**
- Prototype achieves strict token-level parity in greedy mode.
- Current benchmark evidence on tested short/10s workloads shows latency regression
  (extra draft compute outweighs target savings).
- Keeping it opt-in preserves a clean default path while enabling continued
  experimentation on acceptance-rate and long-form workloads.

## Decision 18: Replace HF Tokenizer Runtime with Native In-Repo BPE

**Choice:** Implement and ship native byte-level BPE tokenizer (`vocab.json` + `merges.txt` +
`tokenizer_config.json`) in-repo for runtime encode/decode.
**Alternative:** Keep `transformers` tokenizer as runtime dependency.

**Rationale:**
- Removes heavy runtime dependency surface (`transformers`) from core ASR path.
- Reduces install and compatibility risk from upstream tokenizer API changes.
- Keeps tokenizer behavior deterministic and owned inside this repository.
- Maintains compatibility by preserving existing `Tokenizer` public interface and
  enforcing parity via unit/integration tests.

## Decision 19: Remove HF Feature-Extractor Fallback from Runtime `compute_features()`

**Choice:** Make `compute_features()` native-only for runtime inference and support
`do_not_pad`, `max_length`, and `longest` natively.
**Alternative:** Retain HF `WhisperFeatureExtractor` fallback for uncommon padding/sample-rate paths.

**Rationale:**
- Fully removes `transformers` from runtime transcription path.
- Simplifies feature extraction behavior and error handling.
- Keeps predictable performance characteristics and avoids hidden dependency drift.
- Optional research scripts can still evaluate parity vs HF reference implementation.

## Decision 20: Runtime Forced Aligner Backend is Native-Only

**Choice:** Keep runtime `ForcedAligner` backend fixed to native `mlx`;
use `qwen-asr` only in optional parity scripts.
**Alternative:** Continue dual runtime backends (`mlx` + `qwen_asr` + `auto`).

**Rationale:**
- Eliminates runtime PyTorch bridge complexity and cache churn.
- Simplifies CLI/API behavior and dependency expectations for end users.
- Preserves scientific comparability by keeping explicit reference-lane scripts.
- Aligns with project north-star of fully native MLX runtime paths.

## Decision 21: Speaker Diarization Must Be Native and Optional

**Choice:** If diarization ships in runtime, implement it natively on MLX and
package it as an optional extra (`mlx-qwen3-asr[diarize]`).
**Alternatives:** (1) wrap pyannote/silero or other PyTorch diarization stacks
in runtime, (2) add diarization dependencies to core install.

**Rationale:**
- Preserves project identity: fully native Apple Silicon inference paths.
- Avoids dependency bloat and fragile mixed-runtime support in the core package.
- Keeps default install fast/lean for users who only need ASR.
- Enables deeper ASR+timestamp+speaker integration under one owned pipeline.
- Maintains quality rigor by requiring explicit diarization gates (DER/JER +
  latency), consistent with existing parity-gated engineering practice.
