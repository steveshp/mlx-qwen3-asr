# Algorithmic Maxxing Review (2026-02-14)

Focused review of paper-backed inference algorithms that can materially improve
`mlx-qwen3-asr` quality/speed without over-engineering.

## Changes Applied This Session

1. Long-context encoder hybrid execution
- Added segmented per-window encoder execution for large window counts while
  preserving dense-mask path for shorter contexts.
- Benchmark-backed threshold: `num_windows >= 20`.
- Result: avoids long-context dense-mask blow-up while preserving short-input
  latency behavior.

2. Upstream-style repetition cleanup in output parsing
- Added repetition post-processing aligned with official Qwen utilities:
  - long single-character run collapse,
  - long repeated-pattern collapse.
- Upstream reference:
  - `detect_and_fix_repetitions(...)` in
    `qwen_asr/inference/utils.py`:
    https://github.com/QwenLM/Qwen3-ASR/blob/main/qwen_asr/inference/utils.py
- Added edge-case handling for:
  - `language None<asr_text>` empty-audio case,
  - forced language parse path,
  - consistent special-token stripping.

## High-Value Next Algorithms (Paper-Backed)

1. Speculative decoding for 1.7B using 0.6B draft model
- Why: lossless decoding acceleration in autoregressive models (Leviathan et al.).
- Fit here: Qwen3-ASR decode is autoregressive and already has explicit cache
  interfaces (`prefill/step`) that make this implementable.
- Practical gate:
  - token-for-token parity with baseline greedy decode,
  - wall-time speedup on 1.7B short/long clips.

2. VAD + overlap merge for long-form offline transcription
- Why: Whisper/WhisperX long-form robustness is improved by segmentation around
  speech boundaries and alignment-aware merging.
- Fit here: complements current chunker for difficult acoustic conditions.
- Practical gate:
  - no WER/CER regression on existing lane,
  - improved stability on long noisy recordings.

3. Confidence-aware decode safeguards
- Why: ASR hallucination/repetition tail issues are often controllable with
  decode-time confidence heuristics and bounded retries.
- Fit here: can be implemented as optional conservative mode for enterprise use.
- Practical gate:
  - reduces pathological repetition incidents,
  - no measurable average quality regression.

## Not Prioritized (Current Policy)

- Production streaming architecture work remains explicitly deprioritized until
  offline quality/speed/timestamp goals are fully saturated.
